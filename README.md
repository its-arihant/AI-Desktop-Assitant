# AI-Desktop-Assitant
The main purpose of the software is to perform the tasks of the user at certain commands, provided in either of the ways, speech or text.
As a personal assistant, Jarvis assists the end-user with day-to-day activities which we do on our desktop like searching queries in google, playing music, managing youtube, and many more such other commands that make our work easier.It is specially made for those who are blind, visually impaired, or handicapped.
I have taken the help from the youtube videos.
